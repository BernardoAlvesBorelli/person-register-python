# Person Register System in Python

This is my first Python project published on GitHub.  
It was created to test my Python skills, mainly with file handling, JSON, and CLI interaction.  
The project currently works via the command-line interface (CLI), but I may adapt it to a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.
